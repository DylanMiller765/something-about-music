We met too soon, too young, too fast,
two hearts that beay, but could not last.
A fire ignited in the dark
But it was doomed from the very start.

We were like leaves in an autumn breeze,
carried by passion, blind to the freeze.
We didn't know what love could cost,
only that we'd find it, and we'd be lost.

Too naive to see the cracks and flaws,
we held on tight, no matter the cause.
Our hands intertwined, but not enough,
to hold the storms or the hearts that break
when love gets rough.

The world was ours, or so we thought,
yet every promise, every dream we sought,
Faded like whispers in the wind,
As we realized the love we had was
wearing thin.

We danced beneath a sky of gold,
unaware the night was growing cold,
And though the stars above us shined,
They could never fiil the hollowed mind.

We were too young to understand
That loves not always just a hand to hold.
Its also a weight, a burden grand,
A heavy crown, a heart grown cold.
We thought our love was something rare.
But time can strip the truth laid bare,
And all thats left are empty skies,
And broone hearts with hallowed eyes.

We didn't know much it hurt
to love without knowing how to work,
to give so much and ask for none,
yet still, in silence, come undone.

We never learned the art of letting go
So we clung to dreams that couldnt grow.
We never realized we were too young,
To know how bitter love can become.

And now we stand apart, so far
two strangers beneath a different star.
The love we built has turned to dust
crumbled by time and broken trust.

The light we shared has turned to gray
and all our memories start to fade away.
I hear your name, but it feels so strange,
Like a phantom touch, a distant change.
The echos of us grow weak, unsure,
as we search for peace in hearts that once 
were pure.

But deep within a longing stirs,
A whisper, faint as fading blurs/
I wish, perhaps that fate will be kind,
And lead us back to where we were blind
When we were young, when love was all
Before we knew how hard we'd fall.

Maybe one day, when we've grown old,
when hearts have healed and love has folded.
We'll cross paths again, with wiser eyes,
And meet as straners with no disguise.

But if this chapter is where we part
I'll carry you with a heavy heart.
Not bitter, no, but bruised and worn,
A love was once bright, now tattered, torn.

I wish you peace, I wish you grace,
A future filled with some warm embrace/
And if we never meet again ,
I pray you find your way, my friend.

For what we had, though lost in time,
was pure, was real, was truly mine.
But life doesn't pause for loves sweet cry,
It keeps on moving, and we must try
To heal the wounds to let it go,
To find our way in the ebb and flow.

So here's to us, to what we knew,
To love so bright,, yet so askew,
We were too young, too quick, too fast
A fleeting dream that couldn't last
